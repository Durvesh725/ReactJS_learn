// console.log(a);

// var a = 12;

// console.log(a);
//var dec is moved to the top


// in case of functions-----
greet();
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

//therefore, even if we call function above its declaration, it gives output unlike var which gives undefined
//whole body is moved to the top
